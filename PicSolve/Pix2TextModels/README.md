# About the Models
Those models are taken from [breezedeus/pix2text-mfr-1.5](https://huggingface.co/breezedeus/pix2text-mfr-1.5), [breezedeus/pix2text-mfd-1.5](https://huggingface.co/breezedeus/pix2text-mfd-1.5) and [Pix2Text](https://github.com/breezedeus/Pix2Text).

They were actually converted to the [CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) using a [custom made tool](https://github.com/ad-oliviero/onnx2coreml)

The swift code made to use those models is heavily inspired by [Pix2Text](https://github.com/breezedeus/Pix2Text).
